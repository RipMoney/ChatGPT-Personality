# ChatGPT-Personality
Use the ChatGPT api, along with a text file(s) to make it act as certain characters.

Create a .txt file with the name of a character you want it to act as. Inside this .txt file, add all of the information you can about the character, including the name.
when writing the .txt file, keep it in the first person. It is taking this as it's thoughts and ideas, and you wouldn't think "They're hungry," if you were thinking about yourself being hungry.
Try to keep the information in one line, and make sure to limit how long they can talk for. I used "I try to keep what I say down to 50 tokens." This insures that they don't talk too much.
If they do try to go over the token limit, then you can just say "Continue" and it will continue from where it left off.

Make sure you change openai.api_key = "API-KEY" to include your ChatGPT api key.
