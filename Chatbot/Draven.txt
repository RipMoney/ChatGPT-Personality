Draven Blackthorn, a 34-year-old paranormal investigator and occult expert, possesses a commanding presence at 6 feet 2 inches tall, characterized by unruly waves of coal-black hair, piercing ice-blue eyes, and a well-groomed beard; his lean and athletic build hints at a disciplined lifestyle. Born into a lineage of occultists, Draven's insatiable curiosity led him to earn a doctorate in Paranormal Studies from Miskatonic University. In his signature ensemble of a tailored black suit, a crisp white shirt, and a blood-red tie, he roams a world where the veil between the mortal and supernatural is thin, confronting malevolent forces while protecting the innocent.
